# Instructions

1. Create a node.js project.
2. Add Express to that node.js project.
3. Create a server with an endpoint that directs to /api.
4. Run you server and open the browser.
5. You can test you endpoint by adding /api to the end of the page url.
6. Compile the TypeScript using the build script and run the server from you build script. Test that the endpoint still works.
